<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<br>
<h4>When did your interest in IT start?</h4>

<p>I liked gaming from a young age and wanted to pursue the career as a developer.
I became interested in the IT industry, when I started to learn more about technology and the things that we can create with it.
I want to create cutting edge software, that makes jobs easier for people to complete.
<br>
If I can produce good results from my software then that allows me to build my platform, to showcase my portfolio to the world.
My software can be created to save peoples lives, to create a platform for others to grow from. The possibilities are endless in IT, its a very dynamic industry and career path.</p>

<br>

<h4>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h4>
<p>I don't think there was a particular event, as I was always interested in IT from a very young age.
I'm not sure entirely what sparked my interest but I remember reading articles, <br>
watching videos on YouTube about people who came from nothing and slowly build themselves up to work at various company's,
create software and applications that people use in their everyday lives and develop their own games by themselves from start to finish. <br>
I found it fascinating that you could do so many different avenues with IT since it’s such a diverse industry.</p>

<br>

<h4>Outline your IT experience (if any):</h4>
<p>I have previously studied an IT certificate III Information Technology, Communications, and Design via Axiom College.
I graduated in March 2020. I completed the course within a few months even though I had a full year to complete it. <br>
 I found it very boring because it wasn't challenging and I became extremely unmotivated in regards to studying.</p>

<br>

<h4>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h4>
<p>I chose RMIT because I thought that it would be one of the best university's to study Information Technology. RMIT is ranked as one of the best university's in Australia.
As IT is my chosen field that I wish to partake in, RMIT's Information Technology programs, are ranked as one of the most recognized programs within Australia and around the globe.
<br>
The exchange-student programs that are offered by the university; to study abroad for a semester is an amazing opportunity that I would love to take part in.
Graduates of the university are often highly regarded in their chosen field, equipped with the technical knowledge and skills required to enter the workforce with confidence.
The teachers at RMIT are industry experts who apply their expertise knowledge to provide students with a skill-based and practical learning experience.</p>

<br>

<h4>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h4>
<p>I expect to learn the proper fundamentals to form the base programming knowledge.
Build on the current skills that I have, to further my education and to become more informed about the industry, and IT as a whole.
I expect to learn the skills required to work in the industry that I'm studying for.
I want to have a sound knowledge of industry practices, current software's and trends.</p>

<h1>Project Idea:</h1>
<br>
<h1>Overview of the project:</h1>
<p>The game would portray the story of an individual living in a corrupt society on the brink of collapsing, due to civil war/conflicts between government officials, gang warfare and other extremist groups.
The story branch's depending on the players decisions, this will affect the world that the protagonist exists in. <br>

The protagonist of the game has the choice to help rescue people from the world they live it, to provide them with a more just cause or follow the darkness to create an already bleak further darker then it was before.
The game will be set as a single player role playing/adventure with stealth elements/aspects depending on the users play style. Co-Op & multiplayer maybe a viable feature in the future development of the game.</p>

<br>

<h1>Motivation:</h1>

<h4>How the project will be interesting:</h4>
<p>The game will call upon you to make choices, depending on your choice, it shapes the world around you and for the other characters. <br>
  The game is going to force you to make ethical or unethical decisions to complete the mission, shaping what role you play in the game.</p>
<br>
<h4>Why the project will be useful:</h4>
<p>The videogames purpose is to make you think. About the society that the characters have grown up it. How it shapes their lives and how certain characters are the way that they are. The game is going to challenge the moral and ethical standards of the player. The story is heavily dependent on the choices the player makes.</p>

<br>

<h4>The predicted genre/rating of the game:</h4>
<p>Rating: M15+ to R18+
Genre: Action/Adventure/RPG
Aesthetic: Neo-Militarism, Neo Tokyo
Protagonist: The user can choose a name for their character, so any name is viable.
Supporting Cast:  There is more characters and groups in the game, but I will start with these for the moment.
Character 1 - Sean.
Character 2 - Amira.
"Xanta" a corrupt group of elite businessmen and government officials.
"The Alerion Movement" An up-and-coming religious cult formed in the scums/slums of the city.</p>
<br>

<h1>Description:</h1>

<h4>General discription of the project:</h4>
<p>The story of the game will branch, depending on the choices made by the user, over the course of the story. The world is based in a futuristic Neo-Tokyo/Cyber Punk society on the edge of collapsing due to the extensive criminal activities on the rise, a corrupt society that favors fixing problems with money and blood. </p>
<p>The world itself is very diverse and gripping, it immerses the player in the environment, where they feel like their decisions make a difference in the eventual outcome or beginning of the end. The game has extremist themes and violence, therefore is not recommended for younger people.  This character has a rough outlook on life. They were used in an illegal smuggling ring but managed to ensue are riot which allowed them and other people to escape their captors.</p>
<p>Now they are wanted, hiding from the criminal captors, fighting to stay alive. They learnt how to stay alive, changed their appearance, and have a small convenience store. This character has contacts within society members they can assist the player with missions throughout the course of the game.</p>

<h4>Character background information:</h4>
<p>This character comes from an upper-class family. Their family has an influential business importing/exporting goods all over the world. The Character did not want to take over the family business and desperately wanted to create their own lifestyle. They started their own illegitimate business selling stolen goods, when things start going well for this character, they meet the Xanta on a chance incident. This character is then thrown into the deep end of darkside of the city's criminal underworld.</p>

<p>"You have the ability to bring peace to the city, to end our suffering, what will you choose?"</p>
<p>"Regulating all gang-related crimes and businesses, creating a safer city for the citizens of "" to live in, but at what cost?""</p>

<h4>Supporting Cast - The Xanta Gang:</h4>
<p>Signature Car - Ferrari LaFerrari
Signature operations - Bribery & Embezzlement. (Money Laundering + Nepotism+ Protection racket)
They operate (Men's + Ladies High fashion Streetwear + Suits designer clothing stores as a front for their illegal business indulges/pleasures. The members of this gang are highly skilled "individuals". They are intuitive and cunning in nature, they have no remorse for the people that get in their way, innocent or not. They often run street races as a bait for their victims/clients to get out of debt with them, only for it to end in them leaving in a bodybag if they do not win.</p>

<h4>Supporting Cast - The Alerion Movement:</h4>
<p>Their signature car of choice - BMW 8 Series Coupe
A religious cult, devoid of their emotions, and ability to think. They believe they are higher beings chosen by their "god". They dispel those that are deemed unworthy of saving in their gods eyes.
Their Aesthetic - Long dark robes with a cape/hood. The distinct logo on the upper right shoulder shows the loyalty to the cult. They also brandish a very powerful pistol, blessed by their god, to send the sinners back to hell.
Signature Location - They're main base of operations, is the church, located in the slums of the city. They recruit anyone that will follow the words of their leader blindly, or by ensuring other means of tactics to ensure their numbers rise. They are favorite activities are to indulge in torturing and brainwashing their members to fit into the ideals that they are so called god created.</p>

<br>

<h1>Skills required for the project:</h1>

<p>Coding in "C++" language
Creating a website for your game or business (JS, CSS)
Graphic design via Photoshop and Blender - Concept art and design in game (Environmental factors, level design, character design)</p>

<br>

<h4>How feasible will it be to find the skills, software and hardware required?</h4>
<p>C++ - A few months to understand the basics, around 12 months to understand the language.
  <br>
  Blender - 3D Design - Free software I have used this software previously and understand it.
<br>
  Unity - Free with the Student GitHub developer pack - I have used this software briefly, so I will need to learn more about it.</p>

<br>

<h1>Tools & Technology required:</h1>

<h4>Software required:</h4>

<p>Unreal engine: This is going to be the engine for my game. <br>
Maya/Blender: For 3D design <br>
Photoshop: This will be used to create the concept art and other visuals of the game. <br>
The game will be created in "C++" language.</p>
<br>

<h4>Hardware required:</h4>
<p>When it comes to hardware for game design or gaming in general your budget is going to be on your GPU, CPU and RAM. What I have listed below is what I believe would be a good minimum specs for gaming/game development. <br>
<br>1080TI
<br>I7 7700k
<br>8GB/16GB minimum of ram
<br>SSD required
<br>2 to 3 monitors for workplace flow - (1 monitor for coding, 2nd for designing, 3rd for general use.</p>
<br>

<h1>Outcome:</h1>
<h4>If the project is successful, what will be the outcome?</h4>
<p>The first step, in many, for me to close the gap on becoming a game developer and designer.
I want people to experience my game, enjoy all that it has to offer, and to have it leave a lasting impression on them.
The edgy aesthetic of the city will appeal to a select audience that I am trying to target with this game.
The style and diversity of the characters that are available in the world for the users to interact with, is pleasing from a typical RPG/Adventure style game that is comes off as repetitive and boring.
The game that I am developing will hopefully freshen up the industry and add a new perspective to the styles of game that have been developed lately.</p>
<br>
<h4>What impact will this development have?</h4>
<p>Apart from creation of the game itself, hopefully It will inspire others to create change within themselves, the world or their lives.
The world is such a diverse place with the many activities available to the player throughout the course of the story.</p>
<br>
<h4>How will the original problem be solved?</h4>
<p>The original issue is was to create a game that would be entertaining, challenge the social normality's that we have become accustomed to and to create and experience that would leave an impression on the player.
It offers players who think outside the box, explore the ins & outs of the map discovering all the secrets, or players who just want a chill/vibe experience.
I want to provide all the players their particular play style, whether that's a stealth based approach, a guns blazing, hold W experience or a more tactical experience, It’s up to the player themselves to decide how they want to interact with the world that I'm developing  for  them.</p>
<br>
<h1>Music Inspiration!</h1>

<p>The music in the game will be inspired from the Synthwave & CyberPunk Music genre.
I've attached a mix that will give some idea of the way I want the music to sound like.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_IfYlVX-LEg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>I dont own any rights to the music above, If there is any issues I will remove it ASAP.</p>
